### My customizations

Based on [Mike Clarke's](https://github.com/mikeclarke) excellent [Villainy Octopress Theme](https://github.com/mikeclarke/villainy-octopress-theme), with many thanks to [Buritica's responsive design](https://github.com/Buritica/villainy-octopress-theme) and helpful styling.

This is my first experimentation with [Octopress](http://octopress.org), my apologies for any sloppy coding. Anything broken is my fault and not the awesome people before me. I did try to move all color variables to `sass/custom/_colors.scss`, which should make the theme easier to modify.

You can see the theme in action [on my webpage](http://garrickadenbuie.com).
